//   Program Structure  2023.12.09
// every program needs almost the next code:

using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hi there!, This is the minimum code of every c# program.");
    }
}

//      Named space
// Named spaces are use in c# to organize and separate the code.
// relationated elements are write in the same named space for clasificating different elements.
// They aren't essential, but makes code easier, breaf and clearer.
// They are an abreviature (e.g.,"System.Console.Writeline();")

//  First line: Include the named space "System" with the key word "using"
// (System is a standart named space that contains different functionalities. )

//  The key word "public" is a modificador de acceso

//  Third line: Define method "Main"
//  Every program needs an access point, a method called "Main".
//  A method is open and close with brackets "{}".
