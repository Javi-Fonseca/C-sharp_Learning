C-sharp tips:
--Environment
-Visual Studio Code provide tools that enable developers to observe 
 the values of application variables while their code is running. 
 Learning how to use those tools saves lots of time during 
 development.

--Tiping
-Printing a tab fills variable length whitespace until a position
 divisible by 4 is reached.
-Use '()' arround the increment or decrement expression improve
 readability.

--Variables
-Avoid creating intermediate variables for interpolation.
-Casting a fractional value will never round up the result.
-Use variables for avoid typos
